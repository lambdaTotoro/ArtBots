# ArtBots for the Procedural Art Collective

At least one bot that does art per week, for all of 2020.

These are hosted at [uberspace](https://uberspace.de) and post to
[Mastodon](https://botsin.space), a decentralised Twitter alternative.

## Running Bots

  - Week 0: [Beautiful Beginnings](https://botsin.space/@beautiful_beginnings), welcomes new Wikipedia articles, posts every 6 hours.
  - Week 1: [Variations on Variations](https://botsin.space/@variations_on_variations), inspired by Max Bill's "Variations" series, posts every 8 hours.
